# sonicbouquet.net

A park bench for the internet. Immerse yourself in a garden of art and poetry while the sound of fresh baked music fills your head, nourishing your frame of reference.

Sonic Bouquet was designed as a place to plant the
music, the art, and the words that have and continue
to enhance my life. Like a lovely garden it doesn't do
much other than grow and brighten one's day.

Do you have "seeds" (music you've recorded, words of
wisdom, or an inspiring image) that you'd like to
share? Did you spot any "weeds"? Want to send a
friend a cutting or two...
